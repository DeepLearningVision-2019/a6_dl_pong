# A6: Pong with deep reinforcement learning
---

Read the paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf) (the paper is also inside the 'Papers' folder in the course materials), and implement a model that can play atari games.

The goals of this project are the following:

- Read and understand the paper.
- Add a brief summary of the paper at the start of the notebook.
- Mention and implement the preprocessing needed; you can add your own steps if needed.
- Load an Atari environment from OpenAI Gym; start with Pong, and try with at least one more.
- Define the convolutional model needed for training.
- Apply deep q learning with your model.
- Use the model to play a game and show the result.

**Rubric:**

1. A summary of the paper was included. The summary covered what the paper does, and why, as well as the preprocessing steps and the model they introduced.
2. Read images from the environment, and performed the correct preprocessing steps.
3. Defined an agent class with the needed functions.
4. Defined the model within the agent class.
5. Trained the model with the Pong environment. Save the weights after each episode.
6. Test the model by making it play Pong.
7. Train and test the agent with another Atari environment of your choosing.

**Deadline:** 04/04/19
